# Lab_Website_3

repo for lab 7 CU CSCI 3308

What works:

1. all provided code for examples in home.ejs
2. all parts of team_stats.ejs
3. The select menu for player_info.ejs

What does not work:

1. get pictures of current selected player
2. get request for player stats -> couldn't quite wrap my head around the necessary db promise chaining for the complex one in time.
